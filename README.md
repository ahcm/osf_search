## Optional Rocket configuration
To configure the included rocket webserver create a file Rocket.toml.

See more on Rocket.toml and startup options:

https://rocket.rs/v0.4/guide/configuration/

E.g.

```toml
[production]
address = "127.0.0.1"
port = 7777
workers = 12
keep_alive = 5
log = "critical"
secret_key = "XXX"
```

Where you replace **XXX** in secret_key with e.g the output of:
```
$ openssl rand -base64 32
```
